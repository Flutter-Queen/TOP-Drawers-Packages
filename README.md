# TOP-Drawers-Packages

The navigation drawer in Flutter allows users to navigate to different pages of your app. The navigation drawer is added using the Drawer widget. It can be opened via a swipe gesture or by clicking on the menu icon in the app bar.

# 1) ELASTIC DRAWER: 
The elastic panel slides in horizontally to show fully customize content (navigation links, menu items, notes, etc.). It behaves like elastic to stretch to go to the next screen.
